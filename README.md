# PyGame
### An exploration of PyGame
#### Overview
PyGame is a set of Python modules created for designing 2D video games. It has a large SDL(Simple DirectMedia Layer) that includes computer graphics and audio resources. In this project, I began with learning about the basic structure of any game and was ultimately able to create video games via PyGame.

#### Basic Game Structure with PyGame
1) Import PyGame
~~~python
import pygame
~~~
2 Initiate Game
~~~python
pygame.init()
~~~
3) Set Display
~~~python
WINDOW_WIDTH = 1000
WINDOW_HEIGHT = 600
displayscreen = pygame.display.set_mode((WINDOW_WIDTH, WINDOW_HEIGHT))
pygame.display.set_caption("Celestial Games")
~~~
6) Set Game Values
7) Set Game Settings(Audio, images, font)
8) Main Gae Loop
9) End Game
