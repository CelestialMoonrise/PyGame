# PyGame
### An exploration of PyGame
#### Overview
PyGame is a set of Python modules created for designing 2D video games. It has a large SDL(Simple DirectMedia Layer) that includes computer graphics and audio resources. In this project, I began with learning about the basic structure of any game and was ultimately able to create video games via PyGame.
